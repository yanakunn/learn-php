# `15` Iframe

The `<iframe>` tag is amazing! It lets you insert a website inside a website. An example of this is Youtube, it uses the `<iframe>` tag to allow you to insert videos from this platform on your own website.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Add an `<iframe>` with a `width` of `1280px` and a `height` of `720px`. Make it point to this url: [https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFQiSDiysWs](https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFQiSDiysWs)

```html
<iframe width="X" height="X" src="here goes the URL"></iframe>
```

> Note: Watching the video won't hurt you 😉
