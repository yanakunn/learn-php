# `05` Create anchors 

In this lesson you are going to start using the attributes of tags. The attributes allow you to provide additional information about HTML elements.

Some attributes that you are going to use a lot are: `href`, `src`, `placeholder`, and there are many more.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Add to the website `<body>` an anchor `<a>` tag that says: `"Click me to search on google"`

2. The anchor `<a>` should take the user to the url [https://google.com](https://google.com) when it is clicked (Use the `href` attribute).

## 💻 Expected Result:

## 💡 Hints:

+ Your code should be something like this:

```md
<a href="url">--your text--</a>
```

+ Read about the `href` attribute: [https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp)

+ Read about absolute vs relative paths here: [http://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/](http://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/)

## 🔎 Important:

+ The given `url` is an ABSOLUTE path because it starts with "http", which means that you are telling the browser you are going to be taking the user OUTSIDE of your website.
