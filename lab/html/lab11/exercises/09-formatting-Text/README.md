# `09` Formatting Text

The way word processing works in documents is pretty standard, you always see the same stuff: Headings, bold text, paragraphs, quotes, etc.

HTML was meant to replicate that exact behavior. Here is an example of a typical document that can be replicated with it:

![HTML preview](../../.learn/assets/09-formating-text.png?raw=true)

## üìù Instructions:

1. Please write the code to replicate the exact same styles of the previous image with pure html, use headings, paragraphs, blockquote, ul and li.

## üí° Hints:

+ You should not add any CSS.

+ For the `<blockquote>` case, the stylings have been already applied in the same file.

+ You should add the `<br />` tag inside the `<blockquote>` in order to add a line break.

+ You can use this text so you don't have to type all that boring stuff:

```md
This will be your heading

Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read

Then you can quote someone to add credibility:

A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking

After all, new generations have these things in common:

+ Don't like to read long texts.
+ Have the attention span of a bird.
+ Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.
```
