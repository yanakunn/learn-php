# `11` Nested Tags

## What are Nested Tags? 🤔

Let's think for a moment of HTML tags as boxes that hold your content; they can contain text, images, and related media... Sometimes, you'll have to place boxes inside other boxes. In this case, those "inner" boxes are `nested` inside of others.

In other words, `Nested Tags` refer to adding a tag inside the same tag as an immediate child.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Let's play with some nested tags, please follow the next instructions:

| Instructions                          | How it should look                      |
| ------------------------------------  | --------------------------------------- |
| 1. Add an `<h1>` tag with a nested `<i>` italic tag. | ![demo](../../.learn/assets/11-nested-tags-1.png?raw=true) |
| 2. Add a `<strong>` tag inside of a `<p>` tag.        | ![demo](../../.learn/assets/11-nested-tags-2.png?raw=true) |
| 3. Add one paragraph `<p>` tag (20 words at least) and one `<h2>` tag inside of an anchor `<a>` tag. | ![demo](../../.learn/assets/11-nested-tags-3.png?raw=true) |

Don't worry if you don't understand it very well yet, it is all about practice! 🤓
