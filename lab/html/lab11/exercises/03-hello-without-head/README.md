# `03` Hello without Head

In the last exercise you had to add all the HTML basic structure of a website.

Do the same for this exercise, but don't include the `<head>` tag.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Add into the `<body>` an `<h1>` heading with your name on it.

## 💻 Expected result:

![Link url](../../.learn/assets/03-hello-without-head.png?raw=true)

## 💡 Hint:

+ The structure should look something like this:

```md
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<h1><!--The name goes here--></h1>
	</body>
</html>
```
