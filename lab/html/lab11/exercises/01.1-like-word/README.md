# `01.1` Like Word

HTML was initially created with the purpose of publishing documents, that is why its `<tags>` are similar to the typical elements you see in a document:

| Tag name | Use case |
| -------- | -------- |
| `<p>`    | To add paragraphs |
| `<strong>`    | Text in bold (stronger) |
| `<h1>`    | Heading with the most importance (bigger) |
| `<h2>`    | Heading with the second importance (smaller) |
| `<a>`    | Links or anchors |
| `<ul>`   | Unordered Lists (Just the bullets) |

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please add a `<p>` tag to your website that says: `HTML tags are similar to MS Word elements`.
