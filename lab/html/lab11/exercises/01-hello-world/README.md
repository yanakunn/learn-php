# `01` Hello World

HTML is a markup language, meaning that everything you type must be wrapped in opening and closing `<tags>`, like this:

```html
<span>Hello, I am a text</span>
<strong>Hello, I am also a text but in bold</strong>
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please `remove` the current website content, `add` the above tags to your website HTML and press "build" to see the results.

![Build](../../.learn/assets/build.png?raw=true)

## 💻 Expected Result:

Your final website should be something like this:

![Preview for 01.1 HTML Exercises](../../.learn/assets/preview-01.1.png?raw=true)

## 💡 Hint:

+ You only have to remove what the file already has and paste the code from the instructions.
