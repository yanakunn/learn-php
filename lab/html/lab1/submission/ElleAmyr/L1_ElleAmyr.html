    <h1 style="color:red;">The Suez Canal</h1>
    The <b>Suez Canal</b> (Arabic: قَنَاةُ السُّوَيْسِ‎, Qanātu s-Suways) is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt,
    connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez and dividing Africa and Asia. In 1858,
    Ferdinand de Lesseps formed the Suez Canal Company for the express purpose of building the canal. Construction of
    the canal lasted from 1859 to 1869 and took place under the auspices of the Ottoman Empire. The canal officially
    opened on 17 November 1869. It offers vessels a direct route between the North Atlantic and northern Indian oceans
    via the <mark>Mediterranean Sea</mark> and the Red Sea, avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans and reducing the
    journey distance from the <u>Arabian Sea</u> to London by approximately 8,900 kilometres (5,500 mi), or 8 days at 24knts to
    10 days at 20knts.[1] The canal extends from the northern terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port
    <s>Klang</s> Tewfik at the city of Suez. <i style="color: yellow;"></p>Its length is 193.30 km (120.11 mi) including its northern and southern
    access-channels .</i> In 2020, more than 18,500 vessels traversed the canal (an average of 51.5 per day).[2]
    The original canal featured a single-lane waterway with passing locations in the Ballah Bypass and the Great
    Bitter Lake.[3] It contained, according to Alois Negrelli's plans, no lock systems, with seawater flowing freely
    through it. In general, the water in the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in
    summer. South of the lakes, the current changes with the tide at Suez.[4]<br><br>
