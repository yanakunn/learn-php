# `05` GET vs POST

Follow these steps:

1. Run the exercise.

2. Fill the form and submit it.

3. You will see how you are redirected to a new window with a URL like the following:

```txt
https://...whatever...?firstname=value&lastname=value&email=value
```

4. Now change the form method to POST.

5. Run the exercise. 

6. Fill the form.

7. Submit again.

Now the URL is a lot more simple, and the data collected from the form is hidden.
