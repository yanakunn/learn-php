      is the second largest public university after Universiti Putra Malaysia
      (UPM). It is about 20 km north of the state capital, Johor Bahru. The

        The history of technical education in this country has been a century
        old. It all began in 1904 when a Technical School began its operation on
        Weld Road (now Jalan Raja Chulan) to teach Technical Assistants for the
        Federated Malay States Departments of Railways, Survey and Public Works.
      </p>
      <p>
        The school was officially known as Treacher Technical School, named
        after Sir William Treacher, the Resident General during that time.
        Students followed classed on part-time basis; they worked and trained
        specifically according to the technical needs of their employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Department In 1941, the Advisory Committee of Technical Schools and the
        Education recommended that the Technical School be elevated to a college
        status and proposed that a new Technical College be constructed. The new
        college was to be built on a 47-acre piece of Government land in Gurney
        Road (now Jalan Semarak), Kuala Lumpur. Plans for the construction of
        the college, however, were put on hold when World War II erupted in
        Peninsular Malaysia.
