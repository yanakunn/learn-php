# Lab 3: Contact Form

The goal of this exercise is to use the CSS components you've learned so far from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) to create a contact form for your website.

## Part 1: Setup

1. Make a copy of your `index.html` from the previous exercise.
2. Name it `contact.html` and save it in the same folder as your `index.html`.
3. Delete the main content from `contact.html`, but keep the header, navigation, and footer if you have it.
4. Paste [this starter code](download/starter_code.html) into your `contact.html` instead.

## Part 2: Create form

### Add input fields
- Use the (form control)[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/form-control/) classes such as `.form-group` and `.form-control` to style your Name, Email, Subject, and Message fields.
- Use the [button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/) component's `.btn` classes to style your Send button.
- When the form submits, have it send to your own email? (Hint: how does the form know which email to send to?)

## Bonus
- Add a header and introductory text to your Contact page.
- Use the [grid classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/) we have already learned to style/position your new content on the page.

### Submission

1. This task must be done in groups (4 people per group). 
2. Please provide your contact information in the HTML `<head>`.
```html
<!--
Lab XX: XXX
Group:
1. Name: [Name], Matrix No: [Matrix Number], Github ID: [Github ID]
2. Name: [Name], Matrix No: [Matrix Number], Github ID: [Github ID]
3. Name: [Name], Matrix No: [Matrix Number], Github ID: [Github ID]
4. Name: [Name], Matrix No: [Matrix Number], Github ID: [Github ID]
-->
```

3. You must place your file in the [**submission**](submission) folder. Within the submission folder, create a folder named after your group.

> Example: /submission/[group-name]/[your-file]
>
> (Note: please replace [Name], [Matrix Number], [Github ID], [group-name], and [your-file] with the appropriate information)
