# Lab 4: Gallery page

Instructions to create a gallery page using Bootstrap:

1. Create a new HTML file called `gallery.html`.
2. Add the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files to your `gallery.html` file by linking to them in the `<head>` section of the file.
3. Create a new section in the body of your `gallery.html` file where you will add your gallery content.
4. Create a container element (`<div class="container">`) inside the gallery section to hold your gallery content.
5. Use Bootstrap's grid system to create a layout for your gallery. For example, you could use the `row` and `col-*` classes to create a grid of cards or images.
6. Create a card for each item in your gallery using Bootstrap's card component. Add an image, title, and description for each card.
7. Use CSS to style your gallery as desired. You can also customize the card component using custom CSS.
8. Add any additional features you want, such as pagination or filtering.
9. Test your gallery page to make sure everything looks and works as expected.
10. Publish your gallery page to your website.

> Remember to refer to the Bootstrap documentation for more detailed instructions and examples of how to use each component. Good luck with your gallery page!
