# Lab 5: Dictionary App

Activity üèÜ :
## Q1: Explain how dictionaryapi works.
Ans:
API Endpoint: The dictionaryapi has a specific endpoint URL that developers can use to send HTTP requests and retrieve word information. In the provided code, the API endpoint is constructed using the following URL format:  let url = `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/${word}`;, where {word} is the word to be searched.

Making Requests: To fetch word information from the API, developers need to make an HTTP request to the API endpoint. In the code, the fetch function is used to make a GET request to the API endpoint with the word appended to the URL.

Response Format: The dictionaryapi responds with data in a specific format, typically JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for machines to parse and generate. It represents structured data as key-value pairs.

## Q2: Where can I find a list of available dictionaries?
Ans:
The provided JavaScript code doesn't explicitly specify the list of available dictionaries. However, it uses the Dictionary API provided by https://api.dictionaryapi.dev. In this code, the API endpoint used is https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/{word}, where {word} is the word to be searched.
