# Lab 1: Fluid Grid

The goal of this exercise use the [responsive grids classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/grid/) from [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) to lay out a columnar website that fluidly resizes based on screen resolution

- Start with the starter code file [`grid_starter.html`](download/grid_starter.html) and css [`grid.css`](download/grid.css) by right-clicking and saving the file it to your computer.
- Use the [Bootstrap grids classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/grid/) to make the content a fluid layout according to the following:

<img src="./download/grid.gif" width="800" />


Bonus: Add images, using the [card group](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/card/) class to organize the content.

Play around with changing the styling (fonts, colors) by editing grid.css.

Or play around with adding more components!
