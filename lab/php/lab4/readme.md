# Downloading and Placing "msoWP" and "exercise" Folders in htdocs

This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of downloading the "phpweb.zip" file, extracting its contents, and placing the "msoWP" and "exercise" folders into the "htdocs" folder. These folders contain PHP and MySQL code, including basic syntax, charts, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. By following these instructions, you will be able to set up and access the PHP files and code within these folders on your local web server.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Downloading the üíæ [msoWP and exercise](download) file**

**Step 2: Placing the "msoWP" and "exercise" folders in htdocs**
- Open your file explorer and navigate to the "htdocs" folder. The "htdocs" folder is typically located in the root directory of your web server.
- Copy the "exercise" folder from the extracted "phpweb" folder.
- Paste the "exercise" folder into the "htdocs" folder.
- Next, copy the "msoWP" folder from the extracted "phpweb" folder.
- Paste the "msoWP" folder into the "htdocs" folder.

A visual representation of the folder structure for the "htdocs" directory with the "msoWP" and "exercise" folders:

```
üìÅXAMPP/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ[Other XAMPP folders]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅhtdocs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅmsoWP/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [msoWP files and subfolders]
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅexercise/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [exercise files and subfolders]
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

>In the above structure, the "XAMPP" directory represents the root directory of XAMPP. Inside the "XAMPP" directory, there is the "htdocs" folder. Within the "htdocs" folder, there are two main folders: "msoWP" and "exercise". These folders contain their respective files and any subfolders you may have within them.
