# Inserting Multiple Rows into a Table

To do this, include multiple lists of column values within the INSERT INTO statement, where column values for each row must be enclosed within parentheses and separated by a comma. Database: demo1, table: persons.

```php
<?php
/* Attempt MySQL server connection. Assuming you are running MySQL
server with default setting (user 'root' with no password) */
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "demo1");
 
// Check connection
if($link === false){
    die("ERROR: Could not connect. " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
 
// Attempt insert query execution
$sql = "INSERT INTO persons (first_name, last_name, email) VALUES
            ('Rifadul', 'Islam', 'rif@mail.com'),
            ('Iqbal', 'Muzakki', 'iqbal@mail.com'),
            ('Irma Zafirah', 'Mohd Ikram', 'irma@mail.com'),
            ('Noor Arinie', 'Norhalil', 'arinie@mail.com')";
if(mysqli_query($link, $sql)){
    echo "Records added successfully.";
} else{
    echo "ERROR: Could not able to execute $sql. " . mysqli_error($link);
}
 
// Close connection
mysqli_close($link);
?>
```

1. The code begins by assigning an SQL query string to the variable `$sql`. In this case, the query is an INSERT INTO statement for the table `persons`. The columns specified in the query are `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`.

2. The VALUES clause contains multiple sets of values, each enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. Each set represents a row to be inserted into the table. In this code, four rows are being inserted with the corresponding values for `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`.

3. The `mysqli_query()` function is used to execute the SQL query. It takes two parameters: the connection object (`$link`) representing the connection to the MySQL server, and the SQL query string (`$sql`) that needs to be executed.

4. If the `mysqli_query()` function returns `true`, indicating that the query was executed successfully, the code inside the `if` block is executed. In this case, it prints the message "Records added successfully." using the `echo` statement, indicating that the insertion of multiple rows was successful.

5. If the `mysqli_query()` function returns `false`, indicating an error in executing the query, the code inside the `else` block is executed. It uses the `mysqli_error()` function to retrieve the specific error message from the MySQL server, concatenates it with the error message "ERROR: Could not able to execute $sql.", and then prints the concatenated error message using the `echo` statement.

By using this code, you can insert multiple rows of data into the "persons" table in the MySQL database and receive appropriate feedback regarding the success or failure of the insertion query execution.
