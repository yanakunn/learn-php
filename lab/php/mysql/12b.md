# Closing the MySQL Database Server Connection

The connection to the MySQL database server will be closed automatically as soon as the execution of the script ends. However, if you want to close it earlier you can do this by simply calling the PHP `mysqli_close()` function.	

```php
<?php
/* Attempt MySQL server connection. Assuming you are running MySQL
server with default setting (user 'root' with no password) */
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "");
 
// Check connection
if($link === false){
    die("ERROR: Could not connect. " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
 
// Print host information
echo "Connect Successfully. Host info: " . mysqli_get_host_info($link);
 
// Close connection
mysqli_close($link);
?>
```

## `mysqli_close($link)`

The `mysqli_close()` function is used to explicitly close a previously opened connection to a MySQL server in PHP. It takes a single parameter, `$link`, which represents the connection object returned by the `mysqli_connect()` function.

Closing the connection is an optional step, as PHP will automatically close the connection at the end of the script execution. However, it is considered a good practice to explicitly close the connection once you no longer need it, as it frees up system resources and ensures the timely release of database connections.

### Syntax

```php
mysqli_close($link);
```

### Parameters

- `$link`: The connection object returned by `mysqli_connect()`. It represents the connection to the MySQL server that needs to be closed.

### Return Value

The `mysqli_close()` function does not have a return value.

### Example

```php
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "");

// Perform database operations...

mysqli_close($link);
```

In the example above, after performing the necessary database operations using the `$link` connection object, the `mysqli_close()` function is called to close the connection explicitly.

It is worth noting that if the script execution ends or the PHP process terminates, the connection will automatically be closed. Therefore, it is not strictly necessary to include the `mysqli_close()` function unless you want to explicitly release the connection resources before the script completes its execution.

Closing the connection is particularly useful when you have a long-running script or when you need to free up resources for other operations in the script.
