# Connecting to MySQL Database Server

Attempt MySQL server connection. Assuming you are running MySQL
server with default setting (user 'root' with no password) 
```php
<?php

$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "");
 
// Check connection
if($link === false){
    die("ERROR: Could not connect. " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
 
// Print host information
echo "Connect Successfully. Host info: " . mysqli_get_host_info($link);

?>
```
The given code snippet demonstrates an attempt to connect to a MySQL server using PHP's mysqli extension. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code starts with the opening PHP tag (`<?php`), indicating the beginning of PHP code.

2. The `mysqli_connect()` function is used to establish a connection to the MySQL server. It takes three arguments: the server name (in this case, "localhost" indicates that the MySQL server is running on the same machine as the PHP code), the username ("root"), and an empty string as the password (assuming the MySQL server has no password set).

3. The `mysqli_connect()` function returns a connection object (`$link`) if the connection is successful. If there is an error in establishing the connection, the code checks the return value of `$link` using the strict comparison operator (`===`). If the connection fails, the `mysqli_connect_error()` function is called to retrieve the error message, and the `die()` function is used to terminate the script execution with an error message.

4. If the connection is successful, the script continues to execute. The `mysqli_get_host_info()` function retrieves information about the MySQL server and the connected host, using the `$link` connection object. The retrieved information is then concatenated with the string "Connect Successfully. Host info: ".

5. Finally, the concatenated string is printed using the `echo` statement, providing feedback to the user about the successful connection and displaying the host information obtained from `mysqli_get_host_info()`.

>Please note that this code assumes a default MySQL server configuration with the username 'root' and no password. In a production environment, it is highly recommended to use a more secure configuration with proper authentication and password protection.
