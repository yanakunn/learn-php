# PHP MySQL Last Inserted ID

For this example, we'll use the same persons table that we've created in the PHP MySQL create tables chapter, which has four columns id, first_name, last_name, and email, where id is the primary key column and marked with the AUTO_INCREMENT flag. Database: demo1, table: persons.

```php
<?php
/* Attempt MySQL server connection. Assuming you are running MySQL
server with default setting (user 'root' with no password) */
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "demo1");
 
// Check connection
if($link === false){
    die("ERROR: Could not connect. " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
 
// Attempt insert query execution
$sql = "INSERT INTO persons (first_name, last_name, email) VALUES ('Padayachy', 'Aathi', 'padayachy@mail.com')";
if(mysqli_query($link, $sql)){
    // Obtain last inserted id
    $last_id = mysqli_insert_id($link);
    echo "Records inserted successfully. Last inserted ID is: " . $last_id;
} else{
    echo "ERROR: Could not able to execute $sql. " . mysqli_error($link);
}
 
// Close connection
mysqli_close($link);
?>
```

1. The code begins by executing an INSERT query using the `mysqli_query()` function. The query inserts a new row into the "persons" table, providing values for the "first_name", "last_name", and "email" columns.

2. If the `mysqli_query()` function returns `true`, indicating that the query was executed successfully, the code inside the `if` block is executed.

3. The `mysqli_insert_id()` function is then used to obtain the last inserted ID associated with the connection represented by `$link`. It retrieves the auto-generated ID value for the most recently inserted row in the table.

4. The last inserted ID is stored in the variable `$last_id`.

5. Finally, the code uses the `echo` statement to display the message "Records inserted successfully. Last inserted ID is: " followed by the value of `$last_id`. This provides feedback to the user about the successful insertion of records and displays the ID of the last inserted row.

6. If there is an error in executing the query, the code inside the `else` block is executed. It uses the `mysqli_error()` function to retrieve the specific error message from the MySQL server and concatenates it with the error message "ERROR: Could not able to execute $sql.".

By utilizing `mysqli_insert_id()`, you can easily obtain the last inserted ID after performing an INSERT operation, allowing you to retrieve and use the generated ID for further processing or referencing related data.
