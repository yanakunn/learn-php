# Deleting Database Table Data

Just as you insert records into tables, you can delete records from a table using the SQL DELETE statement. It is typically used in conjunction with the WHERE clause to delete only those records that match specific criteria or condition. Database: demo1, table: persons.

```php
<?php
/* Attempt MySQL server connection. Assuming you are running MySQL
server with default setting (user 'root' with no password) */
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "demo1");
 
// Check connection
if($link === false){
    die("ERROR: Could not connect. " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
 
// Attempt delete query execution
$sql = "DELETE FROM persons WHERE first_name='padayachy'";
if(mysqli_query($link, $sql)){
    echo "Records were deleted successfully.";
} else{
    echo "ERROR: Could not able to execute $sql. " . mysqli_error($link);
}
 
// Close connection
mysqli_close($link);
?>
```
