# Inserting Data into a MySQL Database Table

The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new rows in a database table. Database: demo1, table: persons.

```php
<?php
/* Attempt MySQL server connection. Assuming you are running MySQL
server with default setting (user 'root' with no password) */
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "demo1");
 
// Check connection
if($link === false){
    die("ERROR: Could not connect. " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
 
// Attempt insert query execution
$sql = "INSERT INTO persons (id, first_name, last_name, email) VALUES (1, 'Tanvir', 'Sakline', 'tanvir@mail.com')";
if(mysqli_query($link, $sql)){
    echo "Records inserted successfully.";
} else{
    echo "ERROR: Could not able to execute $sql. " . mysqli_error($link);
}
 
// Close connection 
mysqli_close($link);
?>
```
The provided code snippet demonstrates the insertion of data into a MySQL database table using PHP's mysqli extension. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code begins by assigning an SQL query string to the variable `$sql`. In this case, the query is an INSERT INTO statement. It specifies the target table `persons` and the columns `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`. The VALUES clause provides the corresponding values to be inserted: `(1, 'Tanvir', 'Sakline', 'tanvir@mail.com')`.

2. The `mysqli_query()` function is used to execute the SQL query. It takes two parameters: the connection object (`$link`) representing the connection to the MySQL server, and the SQL query string (`$sql`) that needs to be executed.

3. If the `mysqli_query()` function returns `true`, indicating that the query was executed successfully, the code inside the `if` block is executed. In this case, it prints the message "Records inserted successfully." using the `echo` statement, indicating that the data insertion was successful.

4. If the `mysqli_query()` function returns `false`, indicating an error in executing the query, the code inside the `else` block is executed. It uses the `mysqli_error()` function to retrieve the specific error message from the MySQL server, concatenates it with the error message "ERROR: Could not able to execute $sql.", and then prints the concatenated error message using the `echo` statement.

By using this code, you can insert a new record into the "persons" table in the MySQL database, and receive appropriate feedback regarding the success or failure of the insertion query execution.
