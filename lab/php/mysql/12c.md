# Creating MySQL Database Using PHP

Before saving or accessing the data, we need to create a database first. The `CREATE DATABASE` statement is used to create a new database in MySQL. Let's make a SQL query using the `CREATE DATABASE` statement, after that we will execute this SQL query through passing it to the PHP `mysqli_query()` function to finally create our database. Database: demo1.

```php
<?php
/* Attempt MySQL server connection. Assuming you are running MySQL
server with default setting (user 'root' with no password) */
$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "");
 
// Check connection
if($link === false){
    die("ERROR: Could not connect. " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
 
// Attempt create database query execution
$sql = "CREATE DATABASE demo1";
if(mysqli_query($link, $sql)){
    echo "Database created successfully";
} else{
    echo "ERROR: Could not able to execute $sql. " . mysqli_error($link);
}
 
// Close connection
mysqli_close($link);

```

The provided code snippet demonstrates the execution of a CREATE DATABASE query in MySQL using PHP's mysqli extension. Here's a breakdown of the code:

```php
$sql = "CREATE DATABASE demo1";
if(mysqli_query($link, $sql)){
    echo "Database created successfully";
} else{
    echo "ERROR: Could not able to execute $sql. " . mysqli_error($link);
}
```

1. The code begins by assigning a SQL query string to the variable `$sql`. In this case, the query is `CREATE DATABASE demo1`, which creates a new database named "demo1".

2. The `mysqli_query()` function is used to execute the SQL query. It takes two parameters: the connection object (`$link`) representing the connection to the MySQL server, and the SQL query string (`$sql`) that needs to be executed.

3. The `mysqli_query()` function returns `true` if the query execution is successful. In this code, the return value is used in an `if` condition to determine whether the query was executed successfully.

4. If the `mysqli_query()` function returns `true`, the code inside the `if` block is executed. In this case, it prints the message "Database created successfully" using the `echo` statement, indicating that the CREATE DATABASE query executed without any errors.

5. If the `mysqli_query()` function returns `false`, indicating an error in executing the query, the code inside the `else` block is executed. It uses the `mysqli_error()` function to retrieve the specific error message from the MySQL server, concatenates it with the error message "ERROR: Could not able to execute $sql.", and then prints the concatenated error message using the `echo` statement.

By using this code, you can create a new database named "demo1" in the MySQL server and receive appropriate feedback regarding the success or failure of the query execution.
