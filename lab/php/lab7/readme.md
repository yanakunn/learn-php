# Lab 20: Hospital Management System

The PHP Hospital Management System is a web-based application that manages patient registration and data storage. The system assigns a unique ID to each patient and stores their personal information. To access the Hospital Management System, a username and password are required. It is only accessible by an administrator who has access to the database. The interface is user-friendly and data processing is fast, while personal data is well-protected.

The Hospital Management System consists of three modules: Admin, User (patient), and Doctor. The Admin module has a dashboard where the admin can view patient, doctor, appointment, and query details. Admin can add and manage doctors and their specializations, view and delete user details, view patient details, and manage appointment history. Admin can also view contact queries, doctor and user session logs, generate patient reports, search patients by name and mobile number, and change passwords.

The User (patient) module allows patients to view their profile, appointments, and appointment history. Patients can book appointments, view medical history, update their profile, and recover their password.

The Doctor module has a dashboard where doctors can view their own profile and online appointments, appointment history, manage patients, and search for patients by name and mobile number. Doctors can also update their profile, change passwords, and recover passwords.
