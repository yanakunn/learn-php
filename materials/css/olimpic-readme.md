Write a small table in HTML, such as the Paralympic medal table here, and use CSS to style it. Include the following specifications:

- There should be a centered title for the table, and the table should sit in the center of the view port
- There should be a table with 6 columns, with the headings rank, country, gold, silver, bronze, total in bold centered text
- The rank column should have a black background with white centered text
- The country column should have white background with black left-aligned text
- The gold column should have a gold background, the silver column should have a silver background, the bronze column should have a bronze background, all with black centered text
- The total column should have a green background, and black centered text
- The table should have a solid red border on the outside with rounded corners
- Each cell of the table should have a top and bottom 2 pixel border, with no margin, and 3 pixels of padding at the top and bottom
- When the mouse hovers over a cell, the top and bottom border for that cell should increase to 3 pixels, and the padding at the top and bottom should decrease to 2 pixels
- When the mouse hovers over a row, the data cells in that row should change the background to grey
- The countries should include the flag as a unicode character
