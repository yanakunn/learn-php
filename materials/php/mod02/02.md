# Creating a database for the registration system

To create a MySQL database and define the necessary tables and relationships using phpMyAdmin, follow the steps below:

1. **Access phpMyAdmin:**
   - Open your web browser and enter the URL for your phpMyAdmin installation (e.g., `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` if you installed it locally).

2. **Login to phpMyAdmin:**
   - Enter your MySQL username and password to log in to phpMyAdmin.

3. **Create a Database:**
   - Click on the "Databases" tab in phpMyAdmin.
   - Enter a name for your database in the "Create database" field.
   - Choose an appropriate collation (usually `utf8_general_ci`).
   - Click the "Create" button to create the database.

4. **Create Tables:**
   - Select the newly created database from the left sidebar in phpMyAdmin.
   - Click on the "SQL" tab.

5. **Create the Students Table:**
   - In the SQL editor, enter the following SQL statement to create the students table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE students (
     student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(50),
     email VARCHAR(100),
     password VARCHAR(100)
   );
   ```

   - Click the "Go" button to execute the SQL statement and create the table.

6. **Repeat the Steps for Other Tables:**
   - Similarly, create other necessary tables such as instructors, courses, course schedules, etc., using appropriate SQL statements.
   - Here's an example of creating the instructors table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE instructors (
     instructor_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(50),
     email VARCHAR(100)
   );
   ```

   - Adjust the table structure and attributes based on the requirements of your university academic course registration system.

7. **Define Relationships:**
   - To define relationships between tables, you can use foreign keys.
   - For example, to establish a relationship between the courses and instructors tables, modify the courses table creation SQL statement as follows:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE courses (
     course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     title VARCHAR(100),
     description TEXT,
     instructor_id INT,
     schedule VARCHAR(100),
     max_enrollment INT,
     FOREIGN KEY (instructor_id) REFERENCES instructors(instructor_id)
   );
   ```

   - This creates a foreign key relationship between the `instructor_id` column in the courses table and the `instructor_id` column in the instructors table.

8. **Repeat the Steps for Other Relationships:**
   - Define relationships between other tables as required by your registration system, such as linking students to courses through a registration table.

9. **Verify the Tables:**
   - Once the tables are created, you can verify their existence by selecting the database and browsing the "Structure" tab in phpMyAdmin.

By following these steps, you can create the necessary MySQL database and tables for your university academic course registration system using phpMyAdmin. Remember to adjust the table structures and relationships according to the specific requirements of your system.
