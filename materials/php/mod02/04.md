# Implementing user roles and permissions

In the University Academic Course Registration System, it is important to define different user roles and assign appropriate permissions to ensure proper access and functionality for students, instructors, and administrators. This will help maintain the integrity and security of the system. 

## User Roles

1. Student: This role represents the students who will be registering for academic courses. Students can view and enroll in available courses, view their course schedule, and manage their personal information.

2. Instructor: This role represents the instructors who will be teaching the courses. Instructors can view the courses they are assigned to, manage course materials, grade student assignments, and communicate with students.

3. Administrator: This role represents the system administrators who have full access and control over the system. Administrators can manage user accounts, add or remove courses, assign instructors to courses, generate reports, and perform system maintenance tasks.

## Permissions

### Student Permissions
- View available courses: Students can browse the list of courses offered in the academic semester.
- Enroll in courses: Students can select and enroll in the courses they wish to take.
- View course schedule: Students can view their personal course schedule, including the course name, instructor, and schedule details.
- View grades: Students can access their grades for the completed courses.
- Update personal information: Students can update their personal details like contact information, address, etc.

### Instructor Permissions
- View assigned courses: Instructors can see the list of courses they are assigned to teach.
- Manage course materials: Instructors can upload and update course materials such as syllabus, lecture notes, assignments, etc.
- Grade student assignments: Instructors can assess and grade student assignments and provide feedback.
- Communicate with students: Instructors can send announcements, notifications, and messages to the students enrolled in their courses.

### Administrator Permissions
- Manage user accounts: Administrators can create, update, and delete user accounts for students, instructors, and other administrators.
- Add or remove courses: Administrators can add new courses to the system or remove existing courses.
- Assign instructors to courses: Administrators can assign instructors to specific courses.
- Generate reports: Administrators can generate reports related to course enrollment, student performance, and other system statistics.
- Perform system maintenance tasks: Administrators have access to system configuration settings and can perform maintenance tasks like backups, updates, etc.

By defining and implementing these user roles and permissions, the University Academic Course Registration System can ensure that users have appropriate access levels and functionality based on their roles, thereby maintaining system security and integrity while providing a smooth user experience.


## Database Design

To implement user roles and permissions in the University Academic Course Registration System, we need to design the database to store user information, roles, and permissions. Here is an example of the database design:

### Table: users

| Column       | Type         | Description                   |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| id           | int(11)      | User ID (Primary Key)         |
| name         | varchar(255) | User's full name              |
| email        | varchar(255) | User's email address          |
| password     | varchar(255) | User's hashed password        |
| role_id      | int(11)      | Foreign key to roles table    |
| is_active    | tinyint(1)   | Flag to indicate user status  |

### Table: roles

| Column       | Type         | Description                   |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| id           | int(11)      | Role ID (Primary Key)         |
| name         | varchar(255) | Role name                     |

### Table: permissions

| Column       | Type         | Description                   |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| id           | int(11)      | Permission ID (Primary Key)   |
| name         | varchar(255) | Permission name               |

### Table: role_permissions

| Column       | Type         | Description                   |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| id           | int(11)      | Relationship ID (Primary Key) |
| role_id      | int(11)      | Foreign key to roles table    |
| permission_id| int(11)      | Foreign key to permissions table |


## PHP Code

Now, let's create the PHP code for implementing user roles and permissions in the University Academic Course Registration System. We'll assume you have already established a connection to the MySQL database. 

### create_database.php

```php
<?php
// Connect to MySQL server
$conn = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'username', 'password');

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// Create database
$sql = "CREATE DATABASE course_registration";
if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {
    echo "Database created successfully!";
} else {
    echo "Error creating database: " . mysqli_error($conn);
}

// Close database connection
mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```

### create_tables.php

```php
<?php
// Connect to the course_registration database
$conn = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'username', 'password', 'course_registration');

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// Create users table
$sql_users = "CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT(11) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role_id INT(11) NOT NULL,
    is_active TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles(id)
)";

// Create roles table
$sql_roles = "CREATE TABLE roles (
    id INT(11) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
)";

// Create permissions table
$sql_permissions = "CREATE TABLE permissions (
    id INT(11) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
)";

// Create role_permissions table
$sql_role_permissions = "CREATE TABLE role_permissions (
    id INT(11) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    role_id INT(11) NOT NULL,
    permission_id INT(11) NOT NULL,


    FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (permission_id) REFERENCES permissions(id)
)";

// Execute queries
if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql_users) &&
    mysqli_query($conn, $sql_roles) &&
    mysqli_query($conn, $sql_permissions) &&
    mysqli_query($conn, $sql_role_permissions)) {
    echo "Tables created successfully!";
} else {
    echo "Error creating tables: " . mysqli_error($conn);
}

// Close database connection
mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```

### sample_data.php

```php
<?php
// Connect to the course_registration database
$conn = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'username', 'password', 'course_registration');

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// Insert sample data into roles table
$sql_insert_roles = "INSERT INTO roles (name) VALUES
    ('Student'),
    ('Instructor'),
    ('Administrator')";

// Insert sample data into permissions table
$sql_insert_permissions = "INSERT INTO permissions (name) VALUES
    ('View available courses'),
    ('Enroll in courses'),
    ('View course schedule'),
    ('View grades'),
    ('Update personal information'),
    ('View assigned courses'),
    ('Manage course materials'),
    ('Grade student assignments'),
    ('Communicate with students'),
    ('Manage user accounts'),
    ('Add or remove courses'),
    ('Assign instructors to courses'),
    ('Generate reports'),
    ('Perform system maintenance tasks')";

// Execute queries
if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql_insert_roles) &&
    mysqli_query($conn, $sql_insert_permissions)) {
    echo "Sample data inserted successfully!";
} else {
    echo "Error inserting sample data: " . mysqli_error($conn);
}

// Close database connection
mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```

This is a basic implementation of user roles and permissions in the University Academic Course Registration System. You can customize and expand the code to meet your specific requirements. Remember to replace `'username'` and `'password'` in the `mysqli_connect` function with your own database credentials.

Please note that in a real-world scenario, you would implement more robust security measures, such as input validation, authentication, and authorization checks, to ensure the system's integrity and protect user data.
