# Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source server-side scripting language designed for web development. It was originally created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf and has since been maintained and developed by a large community of developers.

PHP code is typically embedded into HTML code, allowing web developers to dynamically generate web pages on the server side. This means that PHP code is executed on the server before the resulting HTML is sent to the client's web browser, allowing for dynamic content and the ability to interact with databases, files, and other server-side resources.

Some key features of PHP include:

- Flexibility: PHP is a versatile language that can be used for a wide variety of web development tasks, from simple scripts to full-scale web applications.
- Ease of use: PHP is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a syntax that is similar to C and Perl.
- Cross-platform compatibility: PHP can be run on a wide variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
- Interactivity: PHP allows for user input and output, making it possible to create interactive web pages and web applications.
- Scalability: PHP is designed to be scalable, allowing it to handle high traffic websites and web applications.

PHP is used by many popular websites, including Facebook, Wikipedia, and WordPress. It is also a popular choice for web development in the enterprise, due to its ease of use and flexibility.

## Case Study: University Academic Course Registration System

A university academic course registration system is a complex web application that allows students to search, register, and drop courses. The system should also provide an interface for instructors to manage their courses, including grading and attendance tracking.

These are the key steps to building a university academic course registration system using PHP and MySQL.

| Step | Topic | Description |
|:----:|------|------|
| 1 | [Setting up the development environment](mod02/01.md) | Install and configure a web server, PHP, and MySQL on your local machine or a web hosting service.|
| 2 | [Creating a database for the registration system](mod02/02.md) | Use PHPMyAdmin or other tools to create a MySQL database and define the necessary tables and relationships. Tables may include students, instructors, courses, course schedules, etc.|
| 3 | [Building a user registration and login system](mod02/03.md) | Allow users to register for accounts and login to the system securely.|
| 4 | [Implementing user roles and permissions](mod02/04.md) | Define different user roles, such as students, instructors, and administrators, and assign appropriate permissions for each role.|
| 5 | [Creating course and instructor tables in the database](mod02/05.md) | Define the necessary database tables for courses, instructors, and other related information.|
| 6 | [Building a course registration form for students](mod02/06.md) | Allow students to search for and register for courses through a user-friendly form. The form should validate user inputs and display available courses. |
| 7 | [Implementing a course search feature](mod02/07.md) | Allow students to search for courses by various criteria, such as subject, instructor, and time slot.|
| 8 | [Creating a dashboard for administrators](mod02/08.md) | Provide administrators with a dashboard that allows them to manage courses, students, and other system settings. The dashboard should have an easy-to-use interface to add new courses, edit existing courses, and view student enrollment.|
| 9 | [Implementing a grade tracking system for instructors](mod02/09.md) | Allow instructors to manage and track student grades and attendance for their courses. The system should allow instructors to input grades for each assignment or exam and display grades to students.|
| 10 | [Building an email notification system for course updates and changes](mod02/10.md) |Notify students about course updates, cancellations, or changes. The system should send automated emails to students who are registered in the course.|
