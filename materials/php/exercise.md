## [Basic PHP](01-basic.md)
The lab exercise for basic PHP consists of various lessons covering topics such as syntax, variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, arrays, and functions. Each lesson focuses on specific subtopics and provides a result in the form of a link to the corresponding exercise file. The exercises involve practical tasks like understanding basic PHP syntax, writing comments, working with variables, utilizing operators, implementing conditional statements and loops, manipulating arrays, and creating functions with or without parameters. These exercises serve as hands-on practice to reinforce understanding and proficiency in PHP programming.

## [Forms](02-form.md)
The lab exercise for PHP forms covers a range of topics. It begins with lessons on the POST and GET methods for sending form data, explaining their differences and usage. The lesson on the PHP `$_REQUEST` variable introduces an associative array that combines the contents of `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and `$_COOKIE`. The importance of sanitizing and validating form data for security purposes is emphasized in another lesson. Two practical examples are provided: a supply order form and a contact form that collects user feedback. Additionally, the exercise covers file upload functionality and the concept of including common files like headers or footers in multiple web pages. 

## [PHP and MySQL](03-mysql.md)
The lab exercise for PHP and MySQL covers various topics related to interacting with a MySQL database using PHP. The lessons begin with connecting to the MySQL database server using the `mysqli_connect()` function and closing the connection using `mysqli_close()`. Creating a database and tables using SQL statements is explained, along with inserting data into the tables using the `INSERT INTO` statement. The exercise also covers prepared statements for secure SQL queries and retrieving the last inserted ID. Selecting data from tables, filtering records based on conditions, limiting result sets, ordering the result set, updating table data, and deleting records are also included. 

## [Chart.JS and Google Charts](04-chart.md)
The lab exercises for Chart.JS and Google Charts cover various chart types and their configurations. In Chart.JS, you can create bar charts, line charts, mixed charts, radar charts, and doughnut charts by specifying the chart type and configuring the appearance and colors of the chart elements. On the other hand, Google Charts offers pie charts, column charts, combo charts (with different marker types), bubble charts, scatter charts, organization charts, word trees, and dynamic charts that retrieve data from a database to display statistics visually. Each chart type has its unique features and can be customized to suit specific data visualization needs.

## [Advanced PHP Syntax](05-advanced.md)
The table provides information about various lessons related to advanced PHP topics. Each row represents a different lesson and includes details such as the lesson number, topic, description, and a link to access the corresponding file. The topics covered range from shopping cart implementations to features like discount coupons, captcha usage, comments systems, and Trello-like drag and drop cards. The description for each lesson provides an overview of the functionality and purpose of the topic. The "Result" column includes a button with an icon and a link that allows users to access the respective lesson file. This table serves as a comprehensive reference for individuals interested in exploring advanced PHP concepts and implementing related features in their projects.

## [Complete system](06-system.md)
The complete project using PHP and MySQL consists of three different systems: Tourism Management System, Hospital Management System, and COVID19 Testing Management System. Each system has its respective files and directories containing the necessary code and resources for implementation. The Tourism Management System focuses on managing tourism-related activities, the Hospital Management System deals with the management of hospital operations, and the COVID19 Testing Management System handles the management of COVID19 testing procedures. These projects utilize PHP for server-side scripting and MySQL for database management, allowing for dynamic data handling and efficient system functionality.
