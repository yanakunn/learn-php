# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in PHP

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. PHP, a popular server-side scripting language, also supports object-oriented programming. In this paradigm, the code is organized around objects that interact with each other to perform tasks and represent real-world entities or abstract concepts.

To understand OOP in PHP, it's essential to grasp some key concepts:

1. **Classes:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class possess.

2. **Objects:** An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or concept based on the class blueprint.

3. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (properties) and related behavior (methods) into a single unit called an object.

4. **Inheritance:** Inheritance is a mechanism that allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes.

5. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.

6. **Abstraction:** Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into more manageable and understandable components.

These concepts provide a foundation for writing object-oriented code in PHP. By utilizing OOP principles, developers can create modular, maintainable, and reusable code. It promotes code organization, separation of concerns, and flexibility in handling complex systems.

## An example of using object-oriented programming in PHP

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Car Details</title>
</head>
<body>
    <?php
    // Define a class
    class Car {
        // Properties
        public $color;
        public $model;

        // Constructor
        public function __construct($color, $model) {
            $this->color = $color;
            $this->model = $model;
        }

        // Method
        public function startEngine() {
            echo "The $this->color $this->model car is starting the engine.";
        }
    }

    // Create objects from the Car class
    $myCar = new Car("Red", "Honda Civic");
    $anotherCar = new Car("Blue", "Toyota Corolla");
    ?>

    <h1>Car Details</h1>
    <h2>My Car</h2>
    <p>Color: <?php echo $myCar->color; ?></p>
    <p>Model: <?php echo $myCar->model; ?></p>
    <button onclick="<?php $myCar->startEngine(); ?>">Start Engine</button>

    <h2>Another Car</h2>
    <p>Color: <?php echo $anotherCar->color; ?></p>
    <p>Model: <?php echo $anotherCar->model; ?></p>
    <button onclick="<?php $anotherCar->startEngine(); ?>">Start Engine</button>
</body>
</html>
```

> In the above example, we have a PHP code embedded within the HTML code. We define a `Car` class with properties (`$color` and `$model`), a constructor (`__construct()`), and a method (`startEngine()`). We then create two objects (`$myCar` and `$anotherCar`) from the `Car` class and set their properties.
>
> In the HTML section, we display the car details by accessing the object properties (`$myCar->color`, `$myCar->model`, etc.). We also have buttons that, when clicked, invoke the `startEngine()` method for each car object.

## Case Study
An example code for a university academic course registration system that uses strings and regular expressions in PHP:

Certainly! Here's an example of using object-oriented programming in PHP for a university academic course registration system:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Course Registration</title>
</head>
<body>
    <?php
    // Define a class for Student
    class Student {
        // Properties
        private $name;
        private $studentId;
        private $registeredCourses;

        // Constructor
        public function __construct($name, $studentId) {
            $this->name = $name;
            $this->studentId = $studentId;
            $this->registeredCourses = [];
        }

        // Method to register for a course
        public function registerCourse($course) {
            $this->registeredCourses[] = $course;
            echo "$this->name has registered for $course.<br>";
        }

        // Method to display registered courses
        public function displayRegisteredCourses() {
            echo "<h3>$this->name's Registered Courses</h3>";
            if (count($this->registeredCourses) > 0) {
                echo "<ul>";
                foreach ($this->registeredCourses as $course) {
                    echo "<li>$course</li>";
                }
                echo "</ul>";
            } else {
                echo "No courses registered.";
            }
        }
    }

    // Define a class for Course
    class Course {
        // Properties
        private $courseCode;
        private $courseName;

        // Constructor
        public function __construct($courseCode, $courseName) {
            $this->courseCode = $courseCode;
            $this->courseName = $courseName;
        }

        // Getter for course code
        public function getCourseCode() {
            return $this->courseCode;
        }

        // Getter for course name
        public function getCourseName() {
            return $this->courseName;
        }
    }

    // Create student objects
    $student1 = new Student("John Doe", "2021001");
    $student2 = new Student("Jane Smith", "2021002");

    // Create course objects
    $course1 = new Course("CSCI101", "Introduction to Computer Science");
    $course2 = new Course("MATH201", "Linear Algebra");
    $course3 = new Course("ENG202", "English Composition");

    // Register courses for students
    $student1->registerCourse($course1->getCourseName());
    $student1->registerCourse($course2->getCourseName());
    $student2->registerCourse($course1->getCourseName());
    $student2->registerCourse($course3->getCourseName());

    // Display registered courses for students
    $student1->displayRegisteredCourses();
    $student2->displayRegisteredCourses();
    ?>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have a university academic course registration system. We define two classes: `Student` and `Course`. The `Student` class represents a student and has properties like `name`, `studentId`, and `registeredCourses` (an array to store the registered courses). It also has methods like `registerCourse()` to register for a course and `displayRegisteredCourses()` to display the registered courses.

The `Course` class represents a course and has properties like `courseCode` and `courseName`. It has getters (`getCourseCode()` and `getCourseName()`) to access the course details.

We then create student objects (`$student1` and `$student2`) and course objects (`$course1`, `$course2`, and `$course3`). We register courses for students using the `registerCourse()` method and display the registered courses using the `displayRegisteredCourses()` method.

The HTML section of the code is responsible for rendering the output on the web page. It displays the registration information for each student and their registered courses.

When you run this code, it will output the following:

```php
John Doe has registered for Introduction to Computer Science.
John Doe has registered for Linear Algebra.
Jane Smith has registered for Introduction to Computer Science.
Jane Smith has registered for English Composition.

John Doe's Registered Courses
- Introduction to Computer Science
- Linear Algebra

Jane Smith's Registered Courses
- Introduction to Computer Science
- English Composition
```

This example demonstrates how object-oriented programming can be used to model a university course registration system. The `Student` class encapsulates student information and provides methods for course registration and displaying registered courses. The `Course` class represents a course and provides getters for accessing course details. By utilizing objects and their interactions, we can create a scalable and maintainable system for course registration.
