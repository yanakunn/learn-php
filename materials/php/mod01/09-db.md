# Interacting with databases using PHP and SQL
Interacting with databases using PHP and SQL is a common task in web development. PHP provides various functions and extensions to connect to databases, execute SQL queries, and fetch results. Here's a step-by-step overview of how to interact with databases using PHP and SQL:

1. **Establishing a Database Connection:**
   Before interacting with a database, you need to establish a connection. PHP offers several extensions for different database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc. The specific extension depends on the database you are using. For example, to connect to a MySQL database, you can use the `mysqli` or `PDO` extension.

   Example using `mysqli` extension:
   ```php
   <?php
   $host = 'localhost';
   $username = 'your_username';
   $password = 'your_password';
   $database = 'your_database';

   // Create a connection
   $connection = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);

   // Check connection
   if ($connection->connect_error) {
       die("Connection failed: " . $connection->connect_error);
   }

   // Perform database operations...
   $connection->close();
   ?>
   ```

2. **Executing SQL Queries:**
   Once the database connection is established, you can execute SQL queries to perform various operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, or retrieving data. PHP provides methods/functions to execute SQL queries using prepared statements or direct query execution.

   Example using `mysqli` extension:
   ```php
   // Execute a SQL query using mysqli
   $sql = "SELECT * FROM users";
   $result = $connection->query($sql);

   if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
       // Process the query result
       while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
           // Access individual columns of each row
           $username = $row['username'];
           $email = $row['email'];
           // ...
       }
   } else {
       echo "No results found.";
   }

   // Free the result set
   $result->free_result();
   ```

3. **Fetching Results:**
   After executing a SELECT query, you can fetch the results using appropriate methods/functions provided by the database extension. You can iterate over the result set and access individual rows and columns of the query result.

4. **Using Prepared Statements:**
   Prepared statements are a recommended practice to prevent SQL injection attacks and improve performance. Prepared statements use placeholders in the SQL query that are later bound with the actual parameter values.

   Example using `mysqli` extension:
   ```php
   // Prepare a statement with a placeholder
   $stmt = $connection->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");

   // Bind the parameter value
   $username = 'john';
   $stmt->bind_param("s", $username);

   // Execute the prepared statement
   $stmt->execute();

   // Fetch results
   $result = $stmt->get_result();
   while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
       // Process the result
   }

   // Close the statement
   $stmt->close();
   ```

5. **Handling Errors:**
   It's important to handle potential errors during database operations. You can check for errors returned by the database extension and handle them appropriately, such as displaying an error message or logging the error details.

   Example using `mysqli` extension:
   ```php
   // Check for errors during query execution
   if ($connection->errno) {
       die("Query failed: " . $connection->error);
   }
   ```

6. **Closing the Connection:**
   After completing the database operations, it's essential to close the

 database connection to release resources.

   Example using `mysqli` extension:
   ```php
   // Close the database connection
   $connection->close();
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively interact with databases using PHP and SQL, perform various operations, and handle errors during the process.

## Case study
An example of interacting with databases using PHP and SQL within a complete PHP and HTML code for a university academic course registration system:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Course Registration System</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Course Registration System</h1>

    <?php
    // Database configuration
    $host = 'localhost';
    $username = 'your_username';
    $password = 'your_password';
    $database = 'your_database';

    // Create a connection
    $connection = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);

    // Check connection
    if ($connection->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $connection->connect_error);
    }

    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] === "POST") {
        // Get the submitted form data
        $studentName = $_POST["name"];
        $selectedCourse = $_POST["course"];

        // Insert registration details into the database
        $sql = "INSERT INTO registrations (student_name, course) VALUES ('$studentName', '$selectedCourse')";

        if ($connection->query($sql) === TRUE) {
            echo "Registration successful! $studentName has registered for $selectedCourse.";
        } else {
            echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $connection->error;
        }
    }

    // Fetch available courses from the database
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM courses";
    $result = $connection->query($sql);

    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
        ?>
        <form method="POST" action="">
            <label for="name">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required><br>

            <label for="course">Select a course:</label>
            <select name="course" id="course">
                <?php
                while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
                    $courseName = $row['course_name'];
                    echo "<option value='$courseName'>$courseName</option>";
                }
                ?>
            </select>
            <br>

            <input type="submit" value="Register">
        </form>
        <?php
    } else {
        echo "No courses available for registration.";
    }

    // Close the database connection
    $connection->close();
    ?>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have a university academic course registration system. The user interface consists of an HTML form where the student can enter their name and select a course from a dropdown menu. When the form is submitted, the PHP script interacts with the database to insert the registration details into the `registrations` table.

The database connection details are provided at the beginning of the script. You need to replace `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, and `'your_database'` with the actual credentials for your database.

The script first establishes a database connection using the `mysqli` extension. It checks for successful connection establishment, and if there's an error, it displays the connection error message.

If the form is submitted (`$_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] === "POST"`), the script retrieves the student's name and selected course from the form data. It then constructs an SQL query to insert the registration details into the database.

If the query is executed successfully, it displays a success message with the student's name and the course they registered for. Otherwise, it displays an error message with the query and the error details.

The script fetches the available courses from the `courses` table in the database and dynamically populates the dropdown menu in the form.

Finally, the script closes the database

 connection to release resources.

Please note that this is a simplified example for illustrative purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would have more robust validation, data sanitization, error handling, and additional database operations.
